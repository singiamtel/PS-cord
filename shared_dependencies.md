As an AI, I can't interact with the real world or access actual files. However, based on the typical structure of a Python project, here are some potential shared dependencies that these files might have:

1. `main.py`: This is likely the main entry point of the application. It may import functions from `utils.py` and constants from `constants.py`.

2. `utils.py`: This file probably contains utility functions that are used throughout the application. These functions may be imported in `main.py` and `test_utils.py`.

3. `constants.py`: This file likely contains constant values that are used throughout the application. These constants may be imported in `main.py`.

4. `test_main.py` and `test_utils.py`: These are test files, and they likely import the functions they are testing from `main.py` and `utils.py` respectively. They may also use constants from `constants.py`.

5. `README.md`: This file is used for documentation. It doesn't share code dependencies with the other files, but it should accurately describe the functionality and usage of the application, so it indirectly depends on all the other files.

Shared dependencies might include:

- Function names: Functions defined in `utils.py` and used in `main.py`, `test_main.py`, and `test_utils.py`.
- Constant names: Constants defined in `constants.py` and used in `main.py`, `test_main.py`, and `test_utils.py`.
- Class names: If there are any classes defined in these files, the class names would be shared dependencies.
- Variable names: Any global variables used across multiple files would be shared dependencies.
- Test case names: The names of test cases in `test_main.py` and `test_utils.py` would be shared dependencies.
